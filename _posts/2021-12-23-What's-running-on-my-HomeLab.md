## What’s running on my HomeLab

I am running a type one hypervisor named Proxmox. You can opt for ESXi or other alternatives, it all depends on you. 

From there I am running two servers/nodes in one cluster. 

On my first server (Dell optiplex 5040 with 32gb RAM) I’m running LTS 20.04.1 Ubuntu, Ubuntu Server, Home Assistant Operating System, Windows 2k19 server, and one Windows 10 workstation. On my second server (Intel NUC with 32gb RAM) I’m running Kali, LTS 20.04.1 Ubuntu, Ubuntu Server, Windows 2k19 server, and two Windows 10 workstations.

I also have a Raspberry Pi running WireGuard VPN. This is good because I can connect anywhere in the world to my home network. 

On my first server, running Ubuntu, I have Pihole and one docker container running. At this moment I’m only running heimdall. Which is a way to organize all the different IP Addresses in my lab.

On my second server, through Ubuntu, I’m running multiple docker containers. Through Portainer you can manage your different Docker environments (Docker hosts or Swarm clusters) very easily. On Portainer, I manage Nextcloud and a Omada-controller. 


## Plans for the future: 

Minecraft server running on docker. 
Dynamic website.
Discord bot.
Running NextCloud on the Raspberry Pi connected to a 14TB USB 3.0 storage device.
