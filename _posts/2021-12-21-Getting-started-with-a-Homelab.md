Getting started with a HomeLab.

My journey first began when I saw this post on reddit, https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/lo8mol/network_diagram_to_represent_my_one_year/ 
This was about 10 months ago and it was during the time when I just started College as a Freshman.

I was so amazed at this post and didn’t understand a single thing. I kept scrolling through the subreddit, trying to understand all these programs and terms but it just didn’t click. Ten months later came November 2021 and I revisited this subreddit. I was determined to learn everything about what a HomeLab means. At this point, I was doing Try-Hack-Me everyday for about 70 days and wanted to actually do hands-on learning. 

I first had to ask myself a couple questions. Why did I need a Homelab and what was I going to use it for. 

For the first question, I needed a homelab to build out my ideas and test them in an environment where they could fail and be rebuilt. I wanted to learn new technologies and experiment with linux. 

For the second question, I was going to use it to keep learning everyday and get better.

Before I install any applications such as wordpress, pihole, or pfsense I needed to determine the equipment to buy.
