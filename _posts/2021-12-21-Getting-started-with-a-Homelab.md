If you google "restore sql database in docker", you'll probably find 20 other blog posts covering this exact topic...But, for some reason, I still managed to look right past them when I was stuck, and it took me a good hour or so to figure how to get this to work. So I'm sharing it anyway.

This is more of a personal note for future Chad to come back to.

Everything below is bascially a summarized version of the official docs, with small tweaks here and there:

Yesterday, I was watching a Pluralsight course which provided a database `.bak` file to follow along with the examples. I generally like to use Docker when working with SQL Server locally...but as a somewhat novice user, I have found it to be a bit of a pain if you need to deal with restoring or attaching a database.

When I run into these scenarios, I usually spin up an AWS EC2 instance, install SQL server, and work with it that way. There's probably a simpler way to do it using RDS or Azure, but I'm not familiar with those just yet. The other option is if I have a Linux machine at hand, I will use that with Docker and mapped volumes work great.

I do happen to have a Linux machine ready to use...but I was determined to figure out how to get this working on Windows.

I was hoping that since I'm running WSL v2, that using a mapped volume would simply work, but for some reason, I could not get the container to see the files in the directory I mapped. I tried using something like this `-v /mnt/d/docker/volume:/var/opt/mssql/backup` but no luck. Docker would create the `backup` directory, but no files we're visible. To my best effort, my google-fu did not come up with any solutions.

I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as I can.
